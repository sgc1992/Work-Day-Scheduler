# Work-Day-Scheduler
In this project we will are building a simple calender application that will allow us to save events for each hour.
We are using moment.js library to work with date and time.
We have created one row and 3 columns.
First column is for hour, second column is for description and third column is for save button.
In our js file we have used 2 functions.
The first function will display the current time in a moment.js format and the second function is for saving the description to the local storage with setItem.
We are getting the value stored in the local storage by using getItem.
